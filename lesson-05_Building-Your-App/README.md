# Lesson Five: Building your App (10 min)
1. [Building Android](01_Building-Android.md)
2. [Building iOS](02_Building-iOS.md)

Running your app in the Expo client is cool, but we want to run our apps natively. One of React Native's best features is the ability to build both Android and iOS apps using a single code-base.   The proceedure is a little different for Android and iOS so we'll learn how to do each seperately.

Before you build, you will need to create a **free Expo account**.  If you haven't already, do that [here](https://expo.io/signup).   If you try to build without an account, you'll be asked to create one.


## Running Windows?
Windows users must enable WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). To do this, open a powershell terminal as an Administrator :

1) Click the Windows button in your taskbar.
2) Type `powershell`
3) Right-click the 'Windows PowerShell' icon and select 'Run as Adminstrator'
4) Choose 'Yes' when promted to allow PowerShell to make changes to your sytem.

In the PowerShell window, run this command `Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux`

You will be promted to reboot your computer.

Now you need to install a Linux Distro.  You can do this three different ways:

### Install via the Microsoft Store

1) CLIck the 'Windows' button in the taskbar and type 'store'
2) Open the Microsoft Store and search for 'Linux'
3) Select a distro (We reccomend Ubuntu)
