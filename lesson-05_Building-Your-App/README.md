Running your app in the Expo client is cool, but we want to run our apps natively. One of React Native's best features is the ability to build both Android and iOS apps using a single code-base.   The proceedure is a little different for Android and iOS so we'll learn how to do each seperately.

Before you build, you will need to create a **free Expo account**.  If you haven't already, do that [here](https://expo.io/signup).   If you try to build without an account, you'll be asked to create one.
