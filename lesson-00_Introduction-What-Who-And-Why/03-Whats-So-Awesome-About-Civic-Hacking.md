# Why Should We Practice Civic Hacking?

Coding is easy.  Developing reliable software that meets real needs and makes difficult things easy is hard.  It takes more than just developers to produce great solutions.  You also need designers, project managers, architects, writers, content specialists and others working in concert to make things seem easy.   To orchestrate all this activity efficiently the tech industry has created standardized methods of operation.    These common business practices have been perfected over time to favor efficiency and effectiveness. 

As it turns out Goverment services, often derided as inefficent and bureaucratic, stand to gain from the application of practices perfected by IT industry.  Civic Hacking isn't just about provideing civic organizations with fancy new computer progragms, it's about transforming the way Goverment operates.  It's about making government more efficent, more responsive, and more accountable for the benefit of the people it serves.
