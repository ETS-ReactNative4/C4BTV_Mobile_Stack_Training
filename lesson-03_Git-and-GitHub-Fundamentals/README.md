# Lesson Three: Git-and-GitHub-Fundamentals

Code for BTV uses Git for source control.  While you can build a mobile app without using Git, you can't contrubite your code if you don't know a few Git basics.
If you're already familiar with this stuff, feel free to skip this section. 
There's a lot of Git and GitHub tutorials out there, so we'll only go over the Git skills you'll need to pull and contribute code.

To use GitHub you'll need a GitHub account; go to https://github.com/ and create one.  It's free!
