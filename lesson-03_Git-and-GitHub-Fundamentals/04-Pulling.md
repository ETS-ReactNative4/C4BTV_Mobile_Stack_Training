## Pulling and Merging

Before you synch up your local respository with GitHub you'll want to merge changes from other developers first. It's considered common courtesy to handle potential merge conflicts on your computer.  You should fix your problems before sharing your code with the team.  

New, officially-approved code will come down via the master branch, which means we'll need to switch back to master first.
