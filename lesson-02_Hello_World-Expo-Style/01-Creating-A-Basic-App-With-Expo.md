Now that you have your development environment setup, we can start building our first mobile application, "Hello World"

Start by opening up a terminal. Then create or navigate to a folder where you want to keep your projects.  



<p id="gdcalert1" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Hello-World0.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](assets/Capture0.png "image_tooltip")


Once  you're in the folder execute this command


```
expo init hello-world
```


You should be promoted to "Choose a template."


 


![alt_text](assets/Capture1.png "image_tooltip")


"Hello World" is a really simple app, so let's choose the default  'blank.'   Hit 'enter' to accept this as your template.  Expo will now extract the files you need and setup your app.

 

![alt_text](assets/Capture2.png "image_tooltip")


We can run our app by following the instructions on the screen.  Execute these two commands:


```
cd hello-world
expo start

import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default class App extends React.Component {
 render() {
   return (
     <View style={styles.container}>
       <Text>Hello World</Text>
     </View>
   );
 }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
 container: {
   flex: 1,
   backgroundColor: '#fff',
   alignItems: 'center',
   justifyContent: 'center',
 },
});
