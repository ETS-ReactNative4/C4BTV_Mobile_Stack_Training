# Hello World Expo Style

Now that you have your development environment setup, we can start building our first mobile application, "Hello World"

## Creating a Basic App With Expo

Start by opening a terminal. Then create a folder where you want to keep your projects. I'm calling my project directory "my_awesome_projects"

Navigate into your projects folder and execute this command

```
expo init hello-world
```

You should be prompted to "Choose a template.

"Hello World" is a super simple app, so we won't need tab-navigation. Hit 'enter' to accept the default template, 'blank.'  Expo will now extract the files you need and setup your app.

After everything is done installing, Expo will give you instructions on how to start your app.  Type these two commands:

    cd hello-world
    expo start

You should see a UPC symbol in your terminal.  In addition, the Expo Chrome dev tools should open in a Chrome window. You can toggle the Expo Chrome dev tools by pressing 'd' in the Expo terminal.  You don't need the Chrome dev tools, but it provided a more graphical interface to debugging your app.  we'll include instructions for using both.
