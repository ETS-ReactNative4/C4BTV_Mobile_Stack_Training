Now that you have your development environment setup, we can start building our first mobile application, "Hello World"

Start by opening up a terminal. Then create or navigate to a folder where you want to keep your projects.  

    ![alt_text](assets/Capture0.png "image_tooltip")


Once  you're in the folder execute this command

```
expo init hello-world
```


You should be promoted to "Choose a template.

    ![alt_text](assets/Capture1.png "image_tooltip")


"Hello World" is a really simple app, so let's choose the default  'blank.'   Hit 'enter' to accept this as your template.  Expo will now extract the files you need and setup your app.

We can run our app by following the instructions on the screen.  Execute these two commands:


## Taking Your New Development Environment for a Spin

Let's create and run a test app to maker sure everything is working properly.

1. In your terminal, navigate to a folder where you want to create you test app

2. Run the command `expo init test-app` You should see some options for app templates

    ![Alt](assets/linux/templates.png "Templates")

3. Choose "blank"  this is only a test.

4. When it's done, follow the direction on the screen to start the app.
    ```bash
    cd test-app
    expo start
    ```

5. The development tools interface should pop up in your Chrome browser.

6. Let's run the app in your Android emulator. Open Genymotion and start an emulator. Once it's started click the "Run on Android device/emulator" button in the left side of the screen.

7. You should have a new virtual device so Expo will try to install the Expo Client App. This may take a while, but you can monitor the progress in the bundler console.

    ![Alt](assets/linux/bundler-console.png "Bundler Console")

8. When the Expo client is loaded, the emulator will prompt you for permission to "draw over other apps."  Click the "OK"
button.

    ![Alt](assets/linux/permissions.png "Permissions")

9. Click the "Allow Display over other apps" toggle so it's on (green)

    ![Alt](assets/linux/toggle.png "Toggle")

10. Click the Back button on the right side to get back to your app.

    ![Alt](assets/linux/back-button.png "Back Button")

11. You should see your app building and then loading. When it's done, you should see this screen:

    ![Alt](assets/linux/app.png "App")

```
cd hello-world
expo start

import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default class App extends React.Component {
 render() {
   return (
     <View style={styles.container}>
       <Text>Hello World</Text>
     </View>
   );
 }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
 container: {
   flex: 1,
   backgroundColor: '#fff',
   alignItems: 'center',
   justifyContent: 'center',
 },
});
